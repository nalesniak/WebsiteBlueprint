    <h2>Create a multi-page website on GitHub Pages.</h2>
        <p>

<strong> If you need text, use some lorem ipsum <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">lipsum.com</a></strong>
<hr>
Each file in your site, including images, should have a file name containing only lowercase letters and numbers (use underscores (_) instead of spaces) to make your life easier. Use the attached starter code to get started with each. To link from one file to another, use the link tag (*a*) and change it so href="index.html" to link to the index file or "href="about.html" to link to the About page.

That being done, add some content, formatting, and additional pages. Look at the sites below for reference, and embellish your site by adding images, formatting text, using several different types of tags, and adding at least one more page with content of your choosing. Please keep in mind that this page is publicly accessible, so you should not put pictures of yourself or other personally identifiable information on this site!

<strong>PUBLISHING</strong>
<ul>
To make your website accessible, go to your repository page, then click Settings -> Pages and choose a branch under "Source" (probably "main") and click "Save". It will now say "Your site is ready to be published at [URL]". It may take ten minutes or so for this to change to "Your site is published at [URL]" which means your site is live and accessible at that URL.
</ul>
<hr>
<strong>Submit as a link to your GitHub pages site AND a link to your repository. The URL will be username.github.io/repositoryname and the repository URL will be github.com/username/repositoryname</strong>
